Hi

I built this blog using a lot of available resources

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Beatifull Jekyll template](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll)
- [Mermaid for the wokflow](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
- GitHub Pages (duh)
- [unDraw for the illustrations](https://undraw.co/)
- Google Analytics
- Google Tag Manger
- Utterance for the comments

Fun fact, I tried with Staticman, so I also implemented a Heroku App, reCaptcha and other stuff, but for some reason I had always a 405 error when trying to post a comment, I will debug the issue when I had more time

I hope that you enjoy my posts and any feedback is more than welcome

Cheers!
